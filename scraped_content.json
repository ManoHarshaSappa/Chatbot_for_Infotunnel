        "Target of Investigation",
        "Acoustic emission (AE) technology is typically used to monitor existing cracks or detect cracks that are developing at a particular location in a steel structural member. AE technology can also be applied to monitor a retrofit that is intended to arrest cracks or stop new fatigue cracks from developing. AE has been used to assess deterioration of steel, such as in detecting and locating fatigue cracks in bridges and tunnels.\n(1-4)",
        "Description",
        "AE is a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technique developed for detecting, locating, and monitoring fatigue cracks in steel elements. AE technology is implemented by mounting one or more acoustic sensors on the surface of the material being tested to detect transient elastic stress waves produced by the evolution of damage in the material. Transient elastic stress waves could be produced, for example, when a crack increases in length because of the application of load. These waves spread through the material and are detected by the acoustic sensors. The waveform signals that the acoustic sensors detect are analyzed to determine the rate at which AE signals produced from damage evolution occur. This analysis helps locate the damage and estimate the rate at which the damage will progress.",
        "The progression of damage, such as the increase in the length of a fatigue crack, produces AE signals. Loading is a likely cause of damage progression. An AE system monitors a structure over time for crack growth caused by applied loads. If a fatigue crack is not increasing in length, AE signals are generally not produced. Consequently, AE is not an effective method for detecting arrested cracks or other damage not progressing under load application. The position of the AE source can be found by triangulating based on the arrival time of the acoustic waves and the wave velocity in the material.",

        "Physical Principle",
        "AE is defined as the rapid release of energy in the form of a transient elastic stress wave that an acoustic source generates. Crack growth, crack fretting, and corrosion act as acoustic sources during damage evolution, producing transient elastic stress waves. Acoustic waves can be detected by placing sensors on the surface of the material being tested. A stimulus, such as an applied load, results in increasing damage in a material, such as the extension of a crack. When crack extension occurs, one or more bursts of waves are released and propagate through the material. A sensor placed on the surface of a material detects the acoustic waves and records the waveform signals for analysis. The waveform signals are analyzed to detect the progression of damage in a material.\n(5,6)\nFigure 2 schematically illustrates the principles of AE.",

        "AE monitoring equipment consists of acoustic sensors, data acquisition electronics, and a computer to analyze the data. Signals received from each sensor are digitized and analyzed using specialized software.",
        "Acoustic sensors are ultrasonic sensors with frequencies that range from 50 kHz to 1 MHz with integrated preamplifiers. Integrated preamplifiers are required to detect AE waveforms produced from damage in the material because acoustic signals are very low in amplitude.",
        "Data Processing",
        "Recorded waveforms are analyzed to determine if the source of a waveform is damage or simply ambient noise caused by nonrelevant sources, such as friction between surfaces, movement of bolted connection or bearings, etc. Figure 3 shows a typical AE waveform. Parameters that describe this waveform include the amplitude of the wave, rise time, total energy in the wave packet, and the number and duration of “counts” (recorded wave cycles that exceeded a certain threshold). Other parameters, such as the frequency characteristics of the waveform and geometric shape of the wave packets, may also be used. These parameters are then used to discriminate between acoustic waves corresponding to damage evolution and ambient noise. Waveforms that correspond to damage evolution are called “AE events.”",

        "Data Interpretation",
        "The rate of occurrence of AE events is interpreted to identify AE sources (i.e., damage) in the material. The location of the source of the AE signal is also used in the interpretation of results. For example, a high number of AE events emanating from a particular location in a structure during the application of loads may indicate damage at that location. The rate of AE events generally increases when damage increases. The increase in AE activity is interpreted as an indication that damage is increasing. The rate of increase in crack length can be estimated from the rate of increase in AE activity.",

The depth range can be set through the modulation frequency of the excitation source to obtain the best possible result. Compared to the transient method, measuring times needed for lock-in thermography are considerably longer.",
        "Physical Principle",
        "IRT is based on measuring thermal radiation emitted by structural elements (figure 2). Thermal radiation, which is in the wavelength range of 0.7–14 μm (0.028–0.55 mils) of the electromagnetic spectrum, is controlled by three main properties that influence the heat flow and distribution within a material: thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and mass density. Exposing the surface of a material to a radiant heat source, such as an IR heater, will cause an increase in surface temperature and diffusion of heat into the material to achieve thermal equilibrium. Subsurface defects, such as delamination or steel corrosion, interrupt the flow of heat. As a result, the surface temperature will be higher in the area of the defect relative to the surface temperature adjacent to the flaw. Therefore, it will cause higher radiation.",

        "Target of Investigation",
        "The primary application of penetrant testing (DPT) in tunnels is detecting and monitoring surface cracks in steel structural members, gusset-plate connections, and welded details in the field. Common applications of the technology include indicating surface porosity, detecting hairline cracks at fatigue-prone details, and verifying visual inspection results.",
        "Description",
        "DPT is a nondestructive method for crack detection in metals. DPT is a process by which a liquid dye is applied to the surface to be inspected; this dye seeps into cracks and other voids or depressions in the surface. The surface is then wiped clean, removing all the excess dye. Dye that has penetrated a crack is not removed by cleaning and emerges from the crack because of capillary action.",
        "This process results in a visible indication of the crack on the surface.\n(1,2)\nSubsurface cracks or volumetric weld defects (porosity, lack of fusion, slag inclusions, etc.) cannot be detected using DPT. Access to the defect is required to preclean the surface, apply penetrant and developer, and visually observe results. Areas that are not easy to access or where other members interfere with access to the surface may be difficult to assess with DPT.",
        "To ensure the indication is easy to visually observe, the color contrast between the liquid dye and the surface undergoing inspection may be enhanced. For typical field inspections, this contrast is accomplished by applying a developer to the surface after it has been cleaned. Developers are typically white; the liquid dye is typically red. The color contrast between the white developer and the red dye ensures an inspector can easily observe crack indications.",
        "Another method for improving the contrast between an indication and the surface being inspected is the use of fluorescent dye. A fluorescent dye contains particles that, when illuminated with ultraviolet light, emit intense visible spectrum light. This fluorescent dye improves the light intensity contrast between the fluorescing crack indicator and the surface under inspection, which is not fluorescing. Generally, dark ambient-light conditions are required to observe the light contrast between the dye and the surface being inspected.\n(1,2)\nConsequently, fluorescent DPT is not commonly used for bridges in the field.",
        "Physical Principle",
        "DPT works on the physical principle of capillary action. Capillary action (or capillary motion) describes the ascent of a liquid along a surface in opposition to gravity. This ascent occurs when the adhesive forces between a liquid and a solid surface exceed the cohesive forces within the liquid itself. As a result, the liquid spreads along the solid surface and can overcome the gravitational forces to climb the surface in a vertical direction. For DPT, liquid confined within a crack emerges on the surface of the material, forming an indication of the presence of the crack on the surface of the material.",
        "Data Acquisition",
        "Figure 1 through figure 4 illustrate several steps in the procedure. The procedure begins with cleaning the surface of the material to remove any existing coating, debris, and foreign material from the area to be assessed. Once the surface has been fully cleaned, a colored dye penetrant is applied in a thin coating on the surface (figure 1). The colored dye is allowed to rest on the surface for a dwell period, lasting 10–30 min. This dwell period allows the dye to penetrate any discontinuities (e.g., cracks) in the surface.",

The currents flowing in the material create a secondary magnetic field that opposes the primary magnetic field of the coil, affecting the impedance of the coil.

ECT in steel can detect only surface or near-surface cracks. Nonferromagnetic materials (e.g., aluminum) have a relative low permeability; therefore, skin depths are larger and subsurface flaws may be detected.",

Several smaller consecutive pulses of gradually increasing intensity may follow the first pulse.

Air-coupled systems can locate defects within 1 ft (0.3 m) of their actual locations and are generally used as a scanning tool to indicate where to perform more indepth testing with other systems, such as ground-coupled radar systems.\n(1)\nAlthough ground-coupled systems are slower, they provide deeper penetration and higher resolution data. Groundcoupled systems can determine depth of a defect within 10 percent of its actual depth, and when reference cores are used, results are within 5 percent of a defect’s actual depth. These systems are also able to detect defects up to 4 ft (1.2 m) deep when the defects contain significant air pockets or moisture.",

Different modes exhibit different displacement characteristics. All modes are dispersive, meaning the velocity of the wave varies as a function of the wavelength (frequency). Because Lamb waves are bounded and guided by plate boundaries, they can propagate over long distances. In contrast to traditional ultrasonic testing, which uses highfrequency pulses and wavelengths that are much smaller than the dimensions of the part being tested, guided waves typically carry energy associated with long wavelengths that resonate in the plate and exhibit low-attenuation characteristics. The frequencies of ultrasonic guided waves that are of interest for civil infrastructure vary, depending on the thickness of the element of interest, from 10 kHz to several hundred kHz. As a result, Lamb waves are complex and can be tuned to a particular application depending on the thickness of the plate, the type of damage of interest, and the distance from the source transducer to the area under inspection.",

        "HCP measurements are based on the coexistence of corroding areas (anodic half-cells) and noncorroding areas (cathodic half-cells). An HCP probe is electrically connected to a steel reinforcement in the concrete. Different probes are available, including copper–copper sulphate (Cu/CuSO\n4\n)\nrods and rolling electrodes, depending on the application. Rolling electrode probes are better suited for rapid scanning of large, horizontal areas.\n(\n3\n)\nA portable half-cell probe, usually a Cu/CuSO\n4\nstandard reference electrode, is placed on the surface of the concrete.\n(\n4\n)\nThe difference in potential between the reinforcement and the reference electrode is measured; these measurements are taken in a grid pattern on the structure to generate a spatial distribution of the corrosion potential. The difference in potential changes with the changing corrosion state of the reinforcing steel; thus, the changes can be indicators of active corrosion of the reinforcement.\n(\n5\n)",

        "The corrosion of steel in concrete is similar to the electrochemical mechanism of the corrosion of a metal in an electrolyte. Separate anodic and cathodic processes take place simultaneously on the same metal surface. At the anodic site, iron is dissolved and then oxidized to iron ions, leaving electrons in the steel. At the cathodic site, oxygen is reduced, and hydroxyl ions are produced.\n(\n6\n)\nThis electrochemical process generates an electrical field.\n(\n3\n)\nThe potential of this field is measured using a high-impedance voltmeter and reference electrode, where the positive terminal of the voltmeter is connected to the reinforcing steel of the structure, and the negative terminal is connected to the reference electrode (figure 2). The reference electrode is usually galvanically connected to the concrete surface using a wet sponge.\n(\n6\n)\nThe input impedance of the voltmeter should be in the range of 10\n6\nto 10\n9\nΩ.\n(\n6\n)",

The heating and cooling behavior of a surface can be used to indicate locations of potential defects. Research and testing have shown that infrared thermography systems are adequate for scanning purposes in tunnels.\n(2)\nWhile these systems cannot measure depth, they may detect moisture-containing voids up to 3 inches (76.2 mm) deep. Infrared thermography can be used for concrete, tile-lined concrete, and shotcrete tunnel linings. Active and passive heating are used in infrared thermography. Active heating uses a heat source, such as halogen lamps or electrical heating, to artificially heat the structure. Passive heating uses environmental conditions to heat the structure.

        "Infrared radiation is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum with wavelengths between 0.7 and 14 µm (0.028 and 0.55 mils). Infrared cameras measure the thermal radiation emitted by a body and capture temperature differences. These temperature variations are the result of heat flow and distribution within the body. These factors are affected by the thermal conductivity, specific-heat capacity, and density of the material.\n(\n1\n)\nDefects can cause heat flow and distribution to vary within the body and resulting surface temperatures to vary from those of a sound material.\n(\n2\n,\n4\n,\n5\n)\nFor sound materials, heat is conducted away from the surface by the mass of the substrate during the heating process; thus, the temperature will increase slowly. For areas with air-filled defects (delamination, debonded tiles, or voids), the air pocket acts as a small insulator, trapping heat in the surface materials and causing the surface to heat faster. For debonded tiles that have moisture within the cavity, the water increases the specific-heat capacity, resulting in slower heating than the surrounding material.\n(\n4\n)\nWhen a structure is cooling, a cavity containing air cools faster than the surrounding sound concrete, and a cavity containing moisture cools slower than the surrounding sound concrete. Because underground water usually has a lower temperature than the ambient air and the structural members in a tunnel, water leakage and moisture intrusion usually register at lower temperatures in thermal images.",
        "Data Acquisition",
        "In tunnels, infrared thermography should be employed as a scanning tool to indicate where indepth testing using other methods should be performed. Scans should be collected every 1 ft (0.3 m) or at an interval determined by the inspector. Thermal images should be collected while the temperature is rising or falling because temperature changes provide a better chance of detecting possible defects. Surveys with handheld infrared cameras can be conducted at walking speed.\n(2)",
        "Since thermal anomalies appear differently depending on environmental conditions, such as the season, planning when and how to conduct surveys is important. Early summer is the best time to conduct thermal surveys. Winter is the worst season; tunnel walls might be frozen, which results in blurry images and increases the likelihood of not detecting all anomalies. Survey direction also affects thermal images, so survey direction should be uniform during evaluations.\n(\n2\n)",
        "The operator must ensure that the camera is properly focused before data collection begins. A typical process for collecting a thermal image is as follows:\n(\n2\n)",
        "Aim the camera at the tunnel lining. Note the temperature of the lining in the center of the display.\nManually set a temperature range of approximately 5 ℉ (2.8 °C) (for example, 60–65 ℉ [15.5–18.3 °C] if the tunnel lining temperature at the center of the display is 62 ℉ [16.7 °C]).\nAdjust the range so that a color spectrum appears on the camera display.\nRecord the image.",
        "Data Processing",
        "Thermal cameras contain data collection and management software. Images are stored with an image number and date and are later transferred to a computer. Thermal camera manufacturers provide software to further refine and inspect the images.

Images of the test site are used to detect moisture intrusion based on relative temperature differences within an image. Sections with excess moisture can be identified as cold spots in thermal images because of the low temperature of underground water. Interpretation of moisture measurements can be difficult because of factors like material emissivity changes, heat transfer through wet sections, cooling through air flow, and spurious radiation sources.\n(5)\nInterpretation of thermal images requires understanding of both thermographic principles and structural engineering practices.\n(3)",

        "Description",
        "MT is a method of locating surface and subsurface discontinuities in ferromagnetic materials. When a part being tested is magnetized, surface cracks cause magnetic field deviations to form above the part’s surface; this is known as magnetic field leakage. Finely divided ferromagnetic particles are applied over the surface of the part. Either dry or wet magnetic particles (delivered in a liquid carrier, such as water or oil) can be used. Some of the particles are gathered and held by the leakage field; this indicates the presence of a discontinuity. This magnetically held collection of particles forms an outline of the discontinuity and indicates its location, size, shape, and extent.",

        "MT works on the physical principles of magnetic induction and magnetic field leakage. This method can only be applied to ferromagnetic materials, such as steel. When a specimen is subjected to a magnetic field, the presence of a defect will cause local distortions in the magnetic field around the defect area. This effect is referred to as magnetic-flux leakage. If fine particles of magnetic material are placed on the specimen in the presence of the magnetic field, they will align with the magnetic-flux lines and the disruption of those lines caused by a defect. This phenomenon is illustrated in figure 1.",

Particles not confined by a magnetic field are removed, and particles confined by magnetic forces remain, forming the indication.",
        "Surface preparation for applying MT includes removing coatings to ensure effective coupling of the magnetic field into the material being tested. Removing the coating also reduces the likelihood of nonrelevant indications forming from debris on the surface or imperfections in the coating itself. Debris or imperfections in the coating can mechanically confine the particles, resulting in a nonrelevant indication. Care must be taken to ensure crack openings are not obscured during mechanical coating removal processes (e.g., grinding).",
        "The orientation of the magnetic fields induced in the material must be orthogonal to a crack opening to ensure a sufficient leakage field to capture magnetic particles. Direct magnetization using prods develops circular magnetic fields around each prod. Consequently, the crack must lie parallel to an imaginary line connecting the prods. In contrast, indirect magnetization results in a magnetic field in the material that is parallel to an imaginary line connecting magnet yokes. Therefore, the crack must be orthogonal to an imaginary line connecting the yokes. When the orientation of cracks is not known, procedures for MT typically require reorientation of the yokes or prods in orthogonal positions to ensure cracks are detected reliably.\n(\n1\n)",

        "Description",
        "The magnetometer (also known as a covermeter, profometer, and pachometer) was first manufactured in the 1950s. The magnetometer is commonly used in conjunction with other nondestructive evaluation technologies. For example, for tests requiring a concrete core sample or contact with embedded steel reinforcement through a drilled hole, a magnetometer can help avoid hitting any reinforcement during drilling. Additionally, a magnetometer can quickly and easily perform construction quality control, for example, if there is a concern about adequate concrete cover.",
        "Physical Principle",
        "Magnetometers operate based on the fact that an electromagnetic field is affected by steel reinforcement but unaffected by nonconductive materials, such as concrete, composite, and timber.",
        "A magnetometer using only one coil operates based on the principle of eddy currents. The alternating current in a primary coil creates a magnetic field. Eddy currents are produced on the surface of any electrically conductive material in the vicinity of the magnetic field. Eddy currents induce a magnetic field in the opposite direction of the primary coil field. This opposition affects the measured impedance in the primary coil. Reinforcing bars that are closer to the magnetometer or are of larger diameters can produce a stronger magnetic field and induce a higher impedance.",
        "The magnetic induction principle is employed when both primary and secondary coils are used. The primary coil is charged while a secondary set of coils picks up the voltage transferred by the magnetic circuit created by the primary coils and rebar. Magnetometers that operate via magnetic induction are less sensitive than those using eddy current principles. Magnetometers using induction operate at frequencies below 90 Hz.",
        "Regardless of the principle used, the size, orientation, and location of rebar (concrete cover thickness) affect voltage measurement in terms of amplitude and phase difference.\n(\n1\n,\n2\n)",
        "Data Acquisition",
        "A magnetometer consists of a magnetic probe and a data processor with a display screen. In some equipment, the probe, data processor, and display screen are integrated into a single lightweight, handheld device. The probe is moved along the surface of a concrete member, such as a slab or wall. As the probe is moved, the operator can observe changes in the magnetic field on the screen in either a digital or graphic format. Rebar orientation can be determined through a planar rotation of the probe at the concrete surface. The longitudinal axis of the probe is aligned with the direction of the rebar when a maximum value of the magnetic field is indicated on the screen of the magnetometer.",
        "Mapping rebar in concrete elements may be accomplished by scanning the concrete surface with the probe in different directions (figure 1). The operator marks the concrete surface when the location and orientation of each rebar are determined.\n(3)\nSome commercially available equipment have the capability to map rebar in concrete decks and display a rebar grid on the screen. The data may be recorded and saved for postprocessing and documentation.",

The data processor is programmed to estimate rebar size and location by comparing detected magnetic field changes with calibrated data from known rebar sizes and known depths inside the concrete being tested.",
        "Data Interpretation",
        "Magnetometers are simple to operate, with minimal operator training required. However, experience is required to interpret the results in complex cases, such as dense rebar placement. To minimize the effect of the nearby ferromagnetic materials, the maximum depth of a concrete cover should be limited to about two-thirds of the distance between two adjacent bars. When both the rebar size and concrete cover thickness are unknown, the operator must assume a value for one (usually the rebar size) to estimate the other unknown parameter.",

        "Advantages of magnetometers include the following:",
        "Rapid information about rebar size, orientation, or concrete cover thickness.\nFieldworthy equipment.\nEasy-to-operate equipment with minimal operator training required.\nAudible output with available headset option for working in noisy environments.\nSome systems applicable to nonferrous metals (e.g., stainless steel bars).\nRelatively inexpensive and commercially available equipment.",

        "Description",
        "PAUT is a nondestructive evaluation technology used to detect defects such as cracks and weld flaws in steel bridge and tunnel components. Figure 1 illustrates the use of PAUT to inspect a butt weld. The technology uses pulses of acoustic waves launched from a transducer. The waves propagate through the material and are reflected from discontinuities in the material. The transducer detects and analyzes the reflected waves. Both longitudinal and shear wave methods can be used. The longitudinal wave method (straight beam) is often used when access to the surfaces of the element under inspection is limited. The longitudinal wave method may also be used for measuring the thickness of a steel plate to detect section loss or for imaging back-surface corrosion pits. The shear wave method (angled beam) is commonly used to detect cracks and to inspect welds for flaws (figure 1).",

Each element in the transducer launches acoustic waves that combine in the material being tested to allow the resulting ultrasonic beam to be steered in different directions or focused at different depths. The ability to steer the ultrasonic beam in different directions increases the volumetric coverage by a single transducer. This allows the technology to direct acoustic energy toward a particular location in the material and allows the wave beam to be scanned across the area where cracking is likely to initiate.",
        "Physical Principle",
        "PAUT identifies defects using the same physical principles as conventional UT, launching acoustic waves from a transducer and analyzing reflections from discontinuities and the physical boundaries of the material being tested. Conventional UT launches and receives waves from a single transducer. In contrast to conventional UT, PAUT uses multiple transducers to launch and receive acoustic waves. The physical principle of wave interference is used to combine waves launched from individual sensors to form a beam of acoustic energy that propagates in a desired direction. This allows the direction of the wave beam to be controlled and steered or focused at a desired distance from a PAUT transducer.",
        "Wave interference occurs when two or more pulses of acoustic waves occupy the same space at the same point in time. Figure 2 illustrates the effect of constructive interference on the amplitude of an acoustic wave. If wave A and wave B occupy the same space and are in phase as shown in the figure, these individual waves will combine to form a wave with an amplitude equal to the sum of the two individual wave amplitudes. This phenomenon is known as constructive interference. PAUT utilizes this phenomenon by launching waves from several individual transducers at different points, so the interference between the individual waves results in a plane wave propagating in a certain direction (figure 3) within the material being tested.\n(\n1\n)",

        "The USW technique is an offshoot of the spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) method used in evaluating material properties (e.g., elastic moduli) in the area very near the surface. SASW uses surface-wave dispersion (i.e., velocity of propagation as a function of frequency and wavelength) in layered systems to obtain information about layer thickness and elastic moduli.\n(7)\nUSW testing is identical to SASW testing except that the frequency range of interest is limited to a narrow high-frequency range in which the phase velocities of surface waves do not vary significantly with frequency. Using either the measured or assumed mass density and Poisson’s ratio of the material, the phase velocity can be converted to the material modulus. A USW test consists of recording the response of the deck at two receiver locations from an impact on the surface of the deck. USW testing equipment is shown in figure 1.",

The waves propagating in a layered medium are dispersive; that is, waves of different wavelengths or frequencies travel with different velocities. Thus, information about the subsurface can be obtained by measuring the phase velocity versus frequency (dispersion curve) and backcalculating the dispersion curve to obtain the profile of the tested system (layer thickness and modulus).",
        "Surface-wave energy extends to a depth of approximately one wavelength. At wavelengths less than or equal to the thickness of the layer, the velocity of surface-wave propagation is more or less independent of wavelength (figure 3 and figure 4). Therefore, if the measurement is limited to wavelengths not exceeding the thickness of the surface course, the velocity of surface waves will be dependent only on the modulus of the surface course material. An average velocity is used for correlating to the material modulus. Significant variation in the phase velocity indicates the presence of delamination or another anomaly.\n(8)",

        "Data Interpretation",
        "Interpretation of UPE testing results is usually simple. The calculated depth may indicate an existing defect if it is less than the thickness of the structural element. For UST, the 3D visualization along with different plane sections (B-, C-, and D-scans) can be used to interpret the data. A color template is used to describe features depending on the strength of the reflection of ultrasonic waves. In most cases, low reflectivity is described using cold colors (blues and greens), while high reflectivity is described using hot colors (reds and yellows). High reflectivity, in most cases, indicates the presence of objects and discontinuities, such as reinforcements, cracks, delaminations, and voids. Low reflectivity, in most cases, indicates a sound condition. Figure 8 shows color-coded B- and C-scan images of a tunnel survey by UST. The color scheme is scaled based on the intensity variations of the reflected shear waves received by the transducer array. Discontinuities, indicated by hot colors, are readily apparent.",

        "Guidelines for interpreting UST data for common defects and features are summarized as follows:",
        "Backwall (element thickness)—Measuring the thickness of an element is based on the evaluation of the travel time of an ultrasonic wave reflected from the backwall. To get a clear reflection from the backwall, it is necessary to have a strong contrast in acoustic impedances of the element material and material behind the backwall. The backwall is identified by a high-amplitude reflection plotted in red. The horizontal reflections from a B-scan indicate a constant thickness of the element.\nReinforcement, conduit, tendons, etc.—Cable-like objects are identified as localized high-intensity reflections. Similar to backwall detection, there must be a contrast in acoustic impedances of the concrete and objects. The most effective way to detect objects is by scanning perpendicularly to the direction of their layout. A single B-scan will identify a linear object as a circular or oval high-amplitude region when the scan is perpendicular to the direction of the object. The position and orientation of a linear object is defined from numerous parallel scans across the object and may be seen from a C-scan. It is generally not possible to identify the material type. Examining the phase of the reflection can provide some insight on whether the reflector is of an acoustic impedance higher or lower than the surrounding concrete. Rebars are most commonly recognized by a regular spacing between detected objects.\nDelamination—Similarly to the backwall, delamination is identified as a high-amplitude linear reflection shallower than the backwall. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the position of the backwall. Since delamination is often a curved and inclined surface, it may appear as a linear object of a variable depth. Since a delamination prevents propagation of an ultrasonic wave below it, the backwall is usually not visible at delamination locations. Instead, ultrasonic waves get confined between the delamination and top surface, which may result in multiple equally spaced reflections with depth in a B-scan.\nAir- and water-filled voids—Voids appear as high-amplitude reflections of a finite size. Because both air- and water-filled voids are of a lower acoustic impedance than concrete, it is nearly impossible to determine whether a void is filled with water.",

        "Description",
        "Vibration testing typically consists of measuring the vibration of the member under inspection using an accelerometer, laser vibrometer, or digital image–processing technique. Time records of member vibrations are analyzed to determine the magnitude and frequency characteristics of the vibrations. The vibration frequency can be compared to mathematical models to estimate the force carried in the member. Typically, the force is estimated to determine if a given member is carrying an increased or decreased load as a result of damage. For example, in a tunnel with ceiling panels, the load levels carried in different ceiling-panel hangers can be used to identify hangers that are not carrying the anticipated loading owing to damage to the hanger or its anchorages. The amplitude and frequency characteristics of vibrations can also be used to analyze high-amplitude vibrations that occur as a result of member resonance.",
        "Physical Principle",
        "The physical principle of vibration testing to analyze force in a member is based on the relationship between the force carried in a member and its resonant frequency of vibration. A taut-string analogy is often used to describe this phenomenon. The equation in figure 1 shows vibration frequency as a function of length, mass, and tension force. If the length and mass of the member are known constants, the tension can be estimated by measuring the resonant frequency.",
